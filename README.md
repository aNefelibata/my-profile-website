Ran into issure a port error. after some research trying to get into the setting (was not able to) I deleted the repo and initial created of the git repo in my files. 
I noticed I couldnt push or fetch meaning my url was messed up. 
I redid all the steps twice and found out I was using the SSH at first. The third time I copied and pasted the url given on GitHub and everything worked out.
